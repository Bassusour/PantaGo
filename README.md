We and my group made an app with Android Studio with the purpose of reducing waste in the city.  
We managed to create an Android app, which uses firebase as a server to store locations of cans and bottles, which all users can see, and go out and pick it up.  
  
The incentive for users to go out and pick up the cans/bottles is that there is a small payment for returning them to the nearest supermarket. 
It is very common in inner Copenhagen to see people go around collecting these cans and bottles for the money. Therefore, the idea of this project is that if you are 
too lazy to deliver your cans to the nearest supermarket, or simply see leftover cans on the street, you can take a picture of them, and post it along with your location to the app.
This makes it much easier for collectors to pick up cans and bottles. 
    
This app supports Google and Facebook accounts, aswell as simply creating your own account.
